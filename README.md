## **Key Features**
### **1. Dynamic Template Generation**
- The platform allows users to dynamically generate legal document templates (e.g., NDAs, contracts, agreements) based on predefined parameters (e.g., parties involved, terms, and clauses).
- Users can create custom document templates that are saved for future use. The AI-driven system will automatically detect the needed elements and customize documents accordingly.

### **2. Customizable Contracts**
- Users input details into a guided form that provides intelligent suggestions, such as standard clauses, terms, and conditions that align with the agreement type.
- These inputs are processed by an AI engine (powered by OpenAI's GPT-3) to create personalized legal documents.

### **3. DocuSign Integration for E-Signatures**
- After the user generates a document, the system integrates with **DocuSign** to send it to recipients for secure electronic signatures.
    - **Real-Time Signing**: Users send the document directly to contacts, who can review and sign in real-time via DocuSign.
    - **Automatic Signature Placement**: DocuSign API automatically places signature fields, initials, and dates, based on the agreement.
    - **Multiple Recipients**: The platform can handle documents that need signatures from multiple people, ensuring everyone’s input is captured efficiently.
    - **Audit Trail**: DocuSign tracks the signing process with a full audit trail, ensuring transparency and security.

### **4. Multi-Recipient Document Distribution**
- Users can select multiple contacts from their database to send documents for review and signing.
- The platform manages communication with recipients, sending emails and tracking responses.

### **5. Document Response Tracking**
- The system monitors when each recipient receives, views, and signs the document.
- Notifications are sent to the user to inform them about the status of the document (e.g., signed, pending, or declined).
- If any recipient rejects or requests changes, the document is sent back for further edits.

### **6. Document Hashing and Blockchain Integration**
- Once documents are signed via DocuSign, the document hash (unique identifier) is generated.
- The hash of the document is stored on a blockchain (Ethereum) to ensure the document’s integrity and authenticity.
    - **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts on Ethereum may be used to trigger specific actions based on document signing.
    - **Document Verification**: When the document is sent back by recipients, it can be verified against the blockchain to ensure it hasn’t been tampered with.
    - **Immutable Records**: The blockchain stores the hash of the document, providing an immutable proof that can be checked at any time to validate its authenticity.

### **7. Document Version Control**
- The platform tracks changes made to documents, allowing users to view versions, compare edits, and revert to earlier versions if necessary.
- Every modification made to a contract is logged, ensuring traceability of changes.

### **8. Notifications and Reminders**
- Automated reminders are sent to recipients who have not signed the document within a specified period.
- Users are notified when the document is signed, rejected, or modified.

### **9. Document Analytics and Risk Detection**
- The platform uses AI to analyze legal documents for potential inconsistencies, risks, or areas that require attention before sending them for signing.
- It can flag clauses that are unusually broad or unclear, offering recommendations to make them more precise.

## **How It Works**
### **1. User Registration and Setup**
- Users create an account using email or social login and set up their profile.
- Users can upload or create legal document templates tailored to their business needs.
- Users specify the parties involved, the agreement type, and any specific clauses needed for the document.

### **2. Dynamic Document Creation**
- Based on the user’s input, the system uses GPT-3 to automatically generate a document draft. It fills in sections such as party names, terms, dates, and clauses.
- Users can customize the document further or let the AI suggest additional clauses.
- The document is saved as a draft, ready for review.

### **3. Sending Documents for Review and Signature**
- The platform enables users to input multiple email addresses of people who need to sign the document.
- The document is sent to the recipients via DocuSign, where they can review and sign the document electronically.
- Users can see who has signed the document and who still needs to sign.

### **4. Document Signing Process with DocuSign**
- Signatories receive an email invitation from DocuSign, prompting them to review and sign the document.
- The signatories complete the signing process using DocuSign’s secure, easy-to-use interface.
- The platform automatically tracks the status of the document: signed, pending, or declined.
- Once all signatories have signed, the platform retrieves the signed document from DocuSign.

### **5. Storing the Signed Document on Blockchain**
- After receiving the signed document, the platform generates a hash of the document to create a unique digital fingerprint.
- This hash is sent to a blockchain (Ethereum) smart contract to be stored, ensuring the document’s integrity.
- The blockchain confirms that the document has not been altered, providing immutable proof that the document was signed and remains unmodified.

### **6. Document Verification and Return Process**
- If the recipient returns a document for any changes, the platform verifies the returned document’s hash against the blockchain.
- If the document’s hash matches the one on the blockchain, it confirms that the document is unchanged and authentic.
- If there’s a mismatch, the document is flagged for review.

## **DocuSign API Integration**
### **Overview**
The **DocuSign API** is used for automating the process of sending, receiving, and tracking signatures on legal documents. It provides various features to handle the signing process securely and efficiently.

### **Steps for DocuSign Integration**
1. **Create DocuSign Account**: Register for a DocuSign Developer account and generate API credentials.
2. **Authenticate**: Use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users, giving them access to send documents for signing.
3. **Document Preparation**: Convert the final legal document into a PDF or other compatible formats.
4. **Send for Signing**:
   - Use the DocuSign API to send the document to recipients for signing.
   - Specify signers, define signature fields, and send the document using the `createEnvelope` API call.
5. **Track Signing Status**: Monitor the signing process via DocuSign’s API to know when the document is signed or needs follow-up.
6. **Retrieve Signed Document**: After signing is completed, retrieve the signed document and store it in your system.

#### **Code Snippet: Sending Document for Signing with DocuSign**
```javascript
const docusign = require('docusign-esign');

// Authenticate with OAuth
const apiClient = new docusign.ApiClient();
apiClient.setBasePath('https://demo.docusign.net/restapi');
apiClient.addDefaultHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

// Create an envelope (document to be signed)
const envelopeDefinition = new docusign.EnvelopeDefinition();
envelopeDefinition.emailSubject = 'Please sign the legal agreement';
envelopeDefinition.documents = [/* your document data */];
envelopeDefinition.recipients = {
    signers: [
        {
            email: 'signer@example.com',
            name: 'Signer Name',
            recipientId: '1',
            routingOrder: '1',
            tabs: {
                signHereTabs: [
                    {
                        anchorString: 'sign_here',
                        anchorYOffset: '10',

                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
};

// Send the envelope
const envelopesApi = new docusign.EnvelopesApi(apiClient);
const results = await envelopesApi.createEnvelope('YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID', { envelopeDefinition });
console.log(`Envelope sent with ID: ${results.envelopeId}`);
```
